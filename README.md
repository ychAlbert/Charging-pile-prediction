# Advanced Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

This project implements an advanced machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. The pipeline is designed to handle complex datasets and build high-performance machine learning models using ensemble techniques.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Includes robust scaling, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
- **Stacking Ensemble Model**: Combines multiple base models (RandomForest, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM) with a meta-model (Logistic Regression) to improve prediction performance.
- **Comprehensive Model Evaluation**: Uses various performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC AUC) and generates confusion matrices and ROC curves.
- **Progress Bar**: Utilizes `tqdm` to display progress bars during training and data analysis.
- **Modular and Extensible**: The code is structured in a modular way, making it easy to extend and maintain.

## Installation
 Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-ml-pipeline.git

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Check the results in the `results/` directory, which includes descriptive statistics, model performance metrics, and visualizations.
